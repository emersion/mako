A lightweight notification daemon for Wayland. Works on Sway.

mako implements the [FreeDesktop Notifications Specification][spec].

Feel free to join the IRC channel: #emersion on irc.libera.chat.

## Running


`mako` will run automatically when a notification is emitted. This happens via
D-Bus activation, so you don't really need to explicitly start it up (this also
allows delaying its startup time and speed up system startup).

If you have several notification daemons installed though, you might want to
explicitly start this one. Some ways of achieving this is:

- If you're using Sway you can start mako on launch by putting `exec mako` in
  your configuration file.

- If you are not using systemd, you might need to manually start a dbus user
  session: `dbus-daemon --session --address=unix:path=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bus`

## Configuration

`mako` can be extensively configured and customized - feel free to read more
using the command `man 5 mako`

For control of mako during runtime, `makoctl` can be used; see `man makoctl`

## Building
Install dependencies:

* meson (build-time dependency)
* wayland
* pango
* cairo
* systemd, elogind or [basu] (for the sd-bus library)
* gdk-pixbuf (optional, for icons support)
* dbus (runtime dependency, user-session support is required)
